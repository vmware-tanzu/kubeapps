# Kubeapps Governance

This document defines the project governance for Kubeapps.

## Overview

**Kubeapps**, an open-source project, is committed to building an open, inclusive, productive and self-governing open source community involved to simplifying how applications are deployed and managed in Kubernetes clusters. The community is governed by this document to define how the community should work together to achieve this goal.

## Code Repositories

The following code repositories are governed by Kubeapps community and maintained under the `kubeapps\kubeapps` organization.

- [kubeapps](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps): Main Kubeapps codebase.
- [hub](https://github.com/kubeapps/hub): Kubeapps Hub UI codebase.

## Community Roles

- **Users**: Members that engage with the Kubeapps community via any medium ([Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/kubeapps), [GitHub](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps), etc.).
- **Contributors**: Members contributing to projects (documentation, code reviews, responding to issues, participation in proposal discussions, contributing code, etc.).
- **Maintainers**: The Kubeapps project leaders. They are responsible for the overall health and direction of the project; final reviewers of PRs and responsible for releases. Maintainers are expected to contribute code and documentation, review PRs including ensuring the quality of code, triage issues, proactively fix bugs and perform maintenance tasks for Kubeapps components.

### Maintainers

New maintainers must be nominated by an existing maintainer and must be elected by a supermajority of existing maintainers. Likewise, maintainers can be removed by a supermajority of the existing maintainers or can resign by notifying one of the maintainers.

### Supermajority

A supermajority of Maintainers is required for certain decisions as outlined above. A supermajority is defined as two-thirds of members in the group. A supermajority vote is equivalent to the number of votes in favor, being at least twice the number of votes against (i.e. if you have 5 maintainers, a supermajority vote is 4 votes).

Voting on decisions can happen on GitHub, Slack, email, or via a voting service, when appropriate. Maintainers can either vote "agree, yes, +1", "disagree, no, -1", or "abstain". A vote passes when supermajority is met. An abstain vote equals not voting at all.

### Decision Making

Ideally, all project decisions are resolved by consensus. If impossible, any maintainer may call a vote. Unless otherwise specified in this document, any vote will be decided by a supermajority of maintainers.

Votes by maintainers belonging to the same company will count as one vote; e.g., 4 maintainers employed by fictional company foo will only have one combined vote. If voting members from a given company do not agree, the company's vote is determined by a supermajority of voters from that company. If no supermajority is achieved, the company is considered to have abstained.

## Proposal Process

One of the most important aspects of any open source community is the concept of proposals. Large changes to the codebase and/or new features should be preceded by a proposal in our community repo. This process allows for all members of the community to weigh in on the concept (including the technical details), share their comments and ideas, and offer to help. It also ensures that members are not duplicating work or inadvertently stepping on toes by making large conflicting changes.

Proposals should cover the high-level objectives, use cases, and technical recommendations on how to implement them. In general, the community member(s) interested in implementing the proposal should be either deeply engaged in the proposal process or be an author of the proposal.

The proposal should be documented as a separate markdown file pushed to the root of the [design-proposals](./docs/reference/design-proposals) folder in the [Kubeapps repository](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps) via PR.

### Proposal Lifecycle

The proposal PR can follow the GitHub lifecycle of the PR to indicate its status:

- **Open**: The proposal is created and under review and discussion.
- **Merged**: The proposal has been reviewed and is accepted (either by consensus or through a vote).
- **Closed**: The proposal has been reviewed and was rejected (either by consensus or through a vote).

### Lazy Consensus

To maintain velocity in a project as busy as Kubeapps, the concept of [Lazy Consensus](http://en.osswiki.info/concepts/lazy_consensus) is practiced. Ideas and/or proposals should be shared by maintainers via GitHub. Out of respect for other contributors, major changes should also be accompanied by a ping on Slack. Author(s) of the proposal, Pull Requests, issues, etc. will give a time period of no less than five (5) working days for comment and remain cognizant of popular observed world holidays.

Other maintainers may chime in and request additional time for review but should remain cognizant of blocking progress and abstain from delaying progress unless absolutely needed. The expectation is that blocking progress is accompanied by a guarantee to review and respond to the relevant action(s) (proposals, PRs, issues, etc.) in short order.

Lazy consensus does not apply to the process of:
Removal of maintainers from Kubeapps

## Updating Governance

All substantive changes in Governance require a supermajority agreement by all [maintainers](./MAINTAINERS.md).
