**[h8lio](https://h8l.io/)**

h8lio is an open source Smart Cloud Factory for software companies, allowing them to focus on their code & business. We've integrated Kubeapps in our automated DevOps chain to help our users to simply install, configure and manage onto our managed Kubernetes the applications their business rely on. Both from public catalog such as Bitnami or from their own Helm charts.

**[Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)**

Kubeapps eases the deployment of our internal Helm charts for everybody, including those that are not familiar with Kubernetes. The ability to seamlessly integrate the Helm values with the web page (basic form support) is an essential feature for us.
