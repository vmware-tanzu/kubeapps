      # The following option controls whether the generated interfaces require
      # the `mustEmbedUnimplemented**Server` method. This method is useful to
      # ensure that when you add a method to a proto service and regenerate
      # files, they will automatically implement the new method and return
      # "Unimplemented", as opposed to not compiling until the new method is
      # added explicitly. But a plugin can still embed the
      # `Unimplemented**Server` struct, it's just not enforced. The
      # unintentional downside of enforcing it via the
      # `mustEmbedUnimplemented**Server` for us is that the
      # `mustEmbedUnimplemented**Server` method is not exposed, which means that
      # *only* implementations in the same package (ie. with access to the same
      # unexposed method) can satisfy the interface. We explicitly want plugins
      # defined in other packages to be able to satisfy a generic gRPC server
      # interface.
      # Created https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/4500 to discuss upstream.
