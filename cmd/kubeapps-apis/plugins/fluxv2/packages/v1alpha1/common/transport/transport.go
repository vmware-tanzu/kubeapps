// this is a copy of fluxcd source-controller internal/transport/transport.go
// It implements a pool of TCP connections. Allows for re-use of TCP
// connections when pulling (downloading) helm charts. Per
// official Go documentation ref https://go.dev/src/net/http/transport.go, L#68-69:
// Transports should be reused instead of created as needed.
// Transports are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

// TransportPool is a progressive and non-blocking pool
// for http.Transport objects, optimised for Gargabe Collection
// and without a hard limit on number of objects created.
//
// Its main purpose is to enable for transport objects to be
// used across helm chart download requests and helm/pkg/getter
// instances by leveraging the getter.WithTransport(t) construct.
//
// The use of this pool improves the default behaviour of helm getter
// which creates a new connection per request, or per getter instance,
// resulting on unnecessary TCP connections with the target.
//
// http.Transport objects may contain sensitive material and also have
// settings that may impact the security of HTTP operations using
// them (i.e. InsecureSkipVerify). Therefore, ensure that they are
// used in a thread-safe way, and also by reseting TLS specific state
// after each use.
//
// Calling the Release(t) function will reset TLS specific state whilst
// also releasing the transport back to the pool to be reused.
//
