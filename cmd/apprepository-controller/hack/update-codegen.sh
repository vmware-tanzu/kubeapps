# To regenerate the api code:
#
# 1. update the .gitmodules in the root directory with the correct branch of code-generator
# and then run: git submodule update --remote
# 2. Run the this script from the apprepository-controller directory: ./hack/update-codegen.sh
# 3. Move the newly generated files over the old ones:
#    mv github.com/vmware-tanzu/kubeapps/cmd/apprepository-controller/pkg/apis/apprepository/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go ./pkg/apis/apprepository/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go
#    rm -rf pkg/client && mv github.com/vmware-tanzu/kubeapps/cmd/apprepository-controller/pkg/client ./pkg
#
# What are the situations when one needs to run update-codegen.sh manually after modifying
# types.go in apprepository-controller?
# Generally if the generated client will change. This can happen for multiple reasons. If you
# change to the `AppRepository.Spec` struct the updated struct is imported by the client (so
# regeneration not needed necessarily) but if your change has a complex type (structs and
# pointers to structs) the generated client will need to be updated as it includes a deep copy
# function. Another cause of your generated client changing is if you update the version of the
# client.go library that your project uses.
# Note that the generated client is generally stored in the repo so that other (external) projects
# can import your client directly. You can see examples of generated clients in the sample-controller
# for the K8s org at:
#  https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/pkg/generated/clientset/versioned/typed/samplecontroller/v1alpha1/samplecontroller_client.go
# or any other controllers in the k8s project
