                object "Update" semantics rather than "Patch" semantics. The caller will provide the

                values for the fields below, which will replace, or be overlayed onto, the

                corresponding fields in the existing resource. For example, with the

                UpdateInstalledPackageRequest, it is not possible to change just the 'package version

                reference' without also specifying 'values' field. As a side effect, not specifying the

                'values' field in the request means there are no values specified in the desired state.

                So the meaning of each field value is describing the desired state of the corresponding

                field in the resource after the update operation has completed the renconciliation.

            The fully qualified identifier for the available package

            (ie. a unique name for the context). For some packaging systems

            (particularly those where an available package is backed by a CR) this

            will just be the name, but for others such as those where an available

            package is not backed by a CR (eg. standard helm) it may be necessary

            to include the repository in the name or even the repo namespace

            to ensure this is unique.

            For example two helm repositories can define

            an "apache" chart that is available globally, the names would need to

            encode that to be unique (ie. "repoA:apache" and "repoB:apache").

            A namespace must be provided if the context of the operation is for a resource

            or resources in a particular namespace.

            For requests to list items, not including a namespace here implies that the context

            for the request is everything the requesting user can read, though the result can

            be filtered by any filtering options of the request. Plugins may choose to return

            to include the repository in the name or even the repo namespace

            to ensure this is unique.

            For example two helm repositories can define

            an "apache" chart that is available globally, the names would need to

            or resources in a particular namespace.

            For requests to list items, not including a namespace here implies that the context

            for the request is everything the requesting user can read, though the result can

            be filtered by any filtering options of the request. Plugins may choose to return

            Unimplemented for some queries for which we do not yet have a need.

              Request for UpdateInstalledPackage. The intent is to reach the
              desired state specified

              by the fields in the request, while leaving other fields intact. This is a whole

              object "Update" semantics rather than "Patch" semantics. The caller will provide the

              values for the fields below, which will replace, or be overlayed onto, the

              corresponding fields in the existing resource. For example, with the

              UpdateInstalledPackageRequest, it is not possible to change just the 'package version

              reference' without also specifying 'values' field. As a side effect, not specifying the

              'values' field in the request means there are no values specified in the desired state.

              So the meaning of each field value is describing the desired state of the corresponding

              field in the resource after the update operation has completed the renconciliation.

            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
            serialized

            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

            type.googleapis.com.


            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

            used with implementation specific semantics.

        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
        with a

        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any;
            any.PackFrom(foo);
            ...
            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
              ...
            }

        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
            ...
            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
            }

          Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

            foo = Foo(...)
            any = Any()
            any.Pack(foo)
            ...
            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
              any.Unpack(foo)
              ...

          Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

              foo := &pb.Foo{...}
              any, err := anypb.New(foo)
              if err != nil {
                ...
              }
              ...
              foo := &pb.Foo{}
              if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                ...
              }

        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

        name "y.z".



        JSON

        ====

        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

            package google.profile;
            message Person {
              string first_name = 1;
              string last_name = 2;
            }

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
              "firstName": ,
              "lastName":
            }

        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
              "value": "1.212s"

            will just be the name, but for others such as those where an available

            package is not backed by a CR (eg. standard helm) it may be necessary

            to include the repository in the name or even the repo namespace

            to ensure this is unique.

            For example two helm repositories can define

            an "apache" chart that is available globally, the names would need to

            encode that to be unique (ie. "repoA:apache" and "repoB:apache").

            for a flux v2 and Carvel it's a semver expression, such as ">=10.3 < 10.4"

      description: >-
        A VersionReference defines a version or constraint limiting matching
        versions.

        The reason it is a separate message is so that in the future we can add other

        fields as necessary (such as something similar to Carvel's `prereleases` option

        to its versionSelection).
