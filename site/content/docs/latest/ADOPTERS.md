If you're using Kubeapps and want to add your organization to this list, follow these directions!

## Adding your organization to the list of adopters

If you are using Kubeapps and would like to be included in the list of Kubeapps Adopters it is possible through the following options:

- **Send a PR**: add an SVG version of your logo that is less than 150 KB to the [logo directory](./docs/logos) in this repo and submit a pull request with your change including 1-2 sentences describing how your organization is using Kubeapps. Name the image file something that reflects your company (e.g., if your company is called Acme, name the image acme.svg).
- **Slack**: Open a new thread in the [Kubeapps slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/kubeapps) with the request and the information described above.
- **Email**: Directly contact through [email](tanzu-kubeapps-team@vmware.com) to our DL.

Project maintainers will help and assess to include your organization as a Kubeapps adopter. Please feel free to send us a message in [#kubeapps](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/kubeapps) with any questions you may have.
