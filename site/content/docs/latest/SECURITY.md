# Reporting a Vulnerability

Kubeapps development is sponsored by VMware and the Kubeapps team encourages users
who become aware of a security vulnerability in Kubeapps to report any potential
vulnerabilities found to security@vmware.com. If possible, please include a description
of the effects of the vulnerability, reproduction steps and a description of in which
version of Kubeapps or its dependencies the vulnerability was discovered.

The use of encrypted email is encouraged. The public PGP key can be found at https://kb.vmware.com/kb/1055.

The Kubeapps team hopes that users encountering a new vulnerability will contact
us privately as it is in the best interests of our users that the Kubeapps team has
an opportunity to investigate and confirm a suspected vulnerability before it becomes public knowledge.

In the case of vulnerabilities found in third-party software components used in Kubeapps, please also notify VMware as described above.
