[VMware Tanzu™ Community Edition (TCE)](https://tanzucommunityedition.io) is a full-featured, easy-to-manage Kubernetes platform for learners and users, especially those working in small-scale or preproduction environments.

[Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) provides a web-based dashboard to deploy, manage, and upgrade applications on a Kubernetes cluster. It is a one-time install that gives you a number of important benefits, including the ability to browse and deploy Helm charts and Carvel packages from public or private repositories and upgrade, manage and delete deployments from your Web browser.

[This guide](introduction.md) walks you through the process of configuring, deploying and using Kubeapps on VMware Tanzu™ Community Edition.
