# Basic Form Support

**NOTE:** Support for the basic form support feature had to be removed in v2.6.0 when the Bitnami catalog updated to include standard json schema files for each chart. We hope to re-enable the ability to define basic forms for users (see [#5988](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/kubeapps/issues/5988)) rather than the current display of all fields from the values.yaml.
