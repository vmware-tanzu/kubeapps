# Custom Form Component Support

This is an extension to the [basic form support](./basic-form-support.md#basic-form-support)

**NOTE:** Support for the basic form support feature had to be removed in v2.6.0 when the Bitnami catalog updated to include standard json schema files for each chart and as a result, also for the custom form component support. We hope to re-enable the ability to define basic forms for users (see [#5988](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/kubeapps/issues/5988)) rather than the current display of all fields from the values.yaml.
